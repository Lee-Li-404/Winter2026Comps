Taxonomy of worms and viruses
-----------------------------

• Creating our own malware 

• We would set up a virtual network with an older version of linux or other unix based operating system, and then utilize a known historical vulnerability to infect the network with a virus of our own creation. Depending on timing, after completing the trivial example, we would update our network to a more recent operating system, and attempt to infect it again, building off the skills we learned in the previous section of the project. 

• Repository with virus code, network that can be attacked and record data about each attack 

• We would set up our network so that it can return proof that each machine was infected, and the intended effects happened.  

• Scale of the project, reproducibility of previous malwares, learning enough quickly in order to be able to complete more than just the trivial example. 

Reading Malware Bytes
---------------------

Malware detection and categorization has traditionally been a challenging and exacting task. Previously, malware analysis was conducted through static or dynamic code analysis. Static code analysis involves disassembling executables to analyze control flows for malicious activities. On the other hand, dynamic code analysis involves executing the malware in a controlled environment to see how it unfolds and affects the host machine. There is yet another method for malware analysis, which leverages machine learning. In this method, malware bytes are encoded as a gray scale image, which are then classified by some machine learning method.

Deliverables can include replication of the findings of this (paper)[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2016904.2016908] or conducting a comparison study between the methods from the (paper)[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2016904.2016908] and more modern architectures.
