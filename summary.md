**Taxonomy of worms and viruses**
• Creating our own malware 
• We would set up a virtual network with an older version of linux or other unix based operating system, and then utilize a known historical vulnerability to infect the network with a virus of our own creation. Depending on timing, after completing the trivial example, we would update our network to a more recent operating system, and attempt to infect it again, building off the skills we learned in the previous section of the project. 
• Repository with virus code, network that can be attacked and record data about each attack \n
• We would set up our network so that it can return proof that each machine was infected, and the intended effects happened.  
• Scale of the project, reproducibility of previous malwares, learning enough quickly in order to be able to complete more than just the trivial example.
